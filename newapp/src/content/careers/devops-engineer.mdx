    - "Plan, create, and maintain CI/CD Pipelines for various services."
    - "Containerize services and workloads efficiently, and deploy them on large-scale using Docker and Kubernetes."
    - "Constantly look for opportunities to optimize the current infrastructure in terms of efficiency and cost."
